// This script is executed by Grails after plugin was installed to project.
// This script is a Gant script so you can use all special variables provided
// by Gant (such as 'baseDir' which points on project base dir). You can
// use 'Ant' to access a global instance of AntBuilder
//
// For example you can create directory under project tree:
// Ant.mkdir(dir:"C:\Users\Paul\Documents\NetBeansProjects/exchange-rates/grails-app/jobs")
//

Ant.property(environment:"env")
